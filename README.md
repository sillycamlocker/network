----------------------------------------

Predict : Uses velocity to predict your target

HitPoint : Target Part ( HumaniodRootPart, Head etc )

NearestOptimalPoint : Finds nearest point on target and uses that point instead of speficic aimpoint

Range Threshold : Will count by studs to determine if they are in stud count and make them valid target or exclude them

Velocity Check : Will calculate the targets hrp velocity ( aa/Vector3 detection )

Resolver : Delta ( recal velocity ), MoveDirection ( hrp movedirection * velocity ), Suppress Velocity ( Checks if hrp is (0, 0, 0)

Default... Airshot... : Default... ( regular value ) Airshot... ( value if target in air or falling )

Rangemanagement : ...Detection ( THIS USES STUDS. IF YOU DONT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT LEAVE IT ALONE. ) Type ( Both = FOV and Prediction is affected by range management ) Only FOV ( Self explanatory ) Only Prediction ( Self Explanatory
